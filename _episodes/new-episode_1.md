> ## Scripting analyses `5 min`
> In small groups, try to think of reasons why you could script an analysis.
> Using the <a href="{{ site.collaborative_notes }}" target="_blank">collaborative notes document</a>,
> jot down any ideas you come up with, so that we have an overall list at the end.
> > ## Ideas
> > Some reasons that are commonly cited are:
> > - Analyses can be repeated by you
> > - Analyses can be replicated by others
> > - Code can be re-used and adapted for similar analyses
> > - Code can be shared with others
> > - Code can be reviewed by others
> > - Code acts as a record of what was done
